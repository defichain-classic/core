## DefichainClassic: An Ethereum-Based Defichain Rework

Priority is given to reducing opinions around chain configuration, IP-based feature implementations, and API predictability.
Upstream development from [ethereum/go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) is merged to this repository regularly,
 usually at every upstream tagged release. Every effort is made to maintain seamless compatibility with upstream source, including compatible RPC, JS, and CLI
 APIs, data storage locations and schemas, and, of course, interoperable node protocols. Applicable bug reports, bug fixes, features, and proposals should be
 made upstream whenever possible.
